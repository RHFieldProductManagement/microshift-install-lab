Welcome to the Microshift install self-paced lab guide. We've put this together to give you an overview into how Microshift installs and works, and how it continues to bring advanced edge capabilities to RHEL.

**Microshift** is the product name for the Kubernetes orchestration component of Red Hat Device Edge. This is often referred to as "**RHDE**" and is the downstream offering for the upstream [Microshift project](https://microshift.io/).

In these labs you'll utilise a RHEL8.7 VM as the base to install microshift on

This is the self-paced lab guide that will run you through the following topics:

- [*Get an understanding of what micoshift is*](introduction.md)
- [*Update the RHEL VM, setup LVM Storage and install pre-requisites for microshift*](preparation.md)
- [*Installing Microshift*](installation.md)

Within the lab environment you can easily copy and paste the specified commands into the CLI; however, for some steps you will also need to edit some of the commands from the instructions. **Be sure to review all commands carefully both for functionality and syntax!**
